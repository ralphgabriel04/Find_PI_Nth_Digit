# Pi Generation Script

## Overview

This Python script allows users to generate the value of Pi (Ï€) to a specified number of decimal places. It incorporates interactive features that enable users to request Pi calculations repeatedly and exit the program as desired. The script is designed with user experience in mind, offering clear instructions and handling input validation effectively.

## Features

- **Customizable Pi Calculation**: Users can specify the number of decimal places for the Pi calculation, allowing for flexibility in the precision of the results.
- **Interactive User Input**: The script includes functions to handle user input, ensuring that only valid numbers are accepted and providing clear feedback for any input errors.
- **Repeat Functionality**: Users can continuously request Pi calculations without restarting the script, enhancing usability for extended sessions.
- **Professional Documentation**: Includes docstrings and comments throughout the code to aid in maintenance and further development.
